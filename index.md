A python library for fractional fixed-point (base 2) arithmetic and binary manipulation with Numpy compatibility.

Some key features:

* Fixed-point signed and unsigned numbers representation.
* Arbitrary word and fractional sizes. Auto sizing capability. Extended precision capability.
* Arithmetic and logical (bitwise) operations supported.
* Input values can be: int, float, complex, list, numpy arrays, strings (bin, hex, dec), Decimal type.
* Input rounding methods, overflow and underflow behaviors and flags.
* Binary, Hexadecimal, and other bases representations (like strings).
* Indexing supported.
* Linear scaling: scale and bias.
* Numpy backend.
* Suppport for Numpy functions. They can take and return Fxp objects.
* Internal behavior configurable: inputs/outputs formating, calculation methods.
